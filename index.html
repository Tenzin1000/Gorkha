		<p class="para"> The Gurkhas or Gorkhas with endonym Gorkhali (Nepali: गोरखाली) are soldiers native to the Indian subcontinent of Nepalese nationality and ethnic Nepalis of Indian nationality recruited for the British Army, Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Gurkha Contingent Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN peacekeeping force and war zones around the world. Historically, the terms "Gurkha" and "Gorkhali" were synonymous with "Nepali", which originates from the hill principality Gorkha Kingdom, from which the Kingdom of Nepal expanded under Prithivi Narayan Shah. The name may be traced to the medieval Hindu warrior-saint Guru Gorakhnath who has a historic shrine in Gorkha. The word itself derived from "Go-Raksha" (Nepali: गोरक्षा), "raksha" becoming "rakha" (रखा). "Rakhawala" means "protector" and is derived from "raksha" as well.<br><br>

There are Gurkha military units in the Nepalese, British and Indian armies enlisted in Nepal, United Kingdom and India. Although they meet many of the requirements of Article 47 of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions regarding mercenaries, they are exempt under clauses 47 and similarly to the French Foreign Legion.<br><br>

Gurkhas are closely associated with the khukuri, a forward-curving Nepali knife, and have a reputation for fearless military prowess. Former Indian Army Chief of Staff Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw once stated that: "If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or he is a Gurkha." </p>

			<p class="para1"><span class="quotes">"Bravest of the brave, most generous of the generous, never had a country more faithful friends than you."</span>  
Professor Sir Ralph Turner MC, ex-3rd Gurkha Rifles<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or is a Gurkha."</span>   
Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw, Indian Chief of Army Staff (8 June 1969 - 15 January 1973)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"The nastiest part about parachuting is landing, and in this, with his compact light body and strong hill legs, he has a distinct advantage over most other races.  For this reason I would say that, along with the Jap who is similarly built, he is probably the best natural parachutist in the world."</span>   
Lieutenant Colonel F J Loftus-Tottenham, 'Walkabouts and Laughabouts in the Raj' (Undated)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"I have never seen more steadiness or bravery exhibited in my life.  Run they would not and of death they seemed to have no fear, though their comrades were falling thick around them, for we were so near that every shot told."</span>   
Ensign John Shipp describing the Battle of Makwanpur, February 1816<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"I must pause in this narrative especially to notice the determined hardihood and bravery with which our two Battalions of Ghoorkhas, The Sirmoor and Nusseeree, met the Sikhs, wherever they were opposed to them.  Soldiers of small stature but indomitable spirit they vied in ardent courage with The Grenadiers of our own nation, and, armed with the short weapons of their mountains, were a terror to the Sikhs throughout this great combat."</span>   
General Sir Hugh Gough, dispatch after the Battle of Sobraon, 1846<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"The Gurkhas were merry little chaps and the only native troops with whom British soldiers were friendly enough for joking and playing tricks."</span>   
Frank Richards, 'Old-Soldier Saheb' (1936)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"The Gurkha is a soldier of high battle-skill, a world-famed fighting man and respected in every country where men fought alongside us in the last war."</span>  
Lieutenant General Sir Francis Tuker, 'While Memory Serves' (1950)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"The Gurkha keeps faith not only with his fellow men but with great spiritual concepts, and above all, with himself."</span>   
John Masters, 'Bugles and a Tiger' (1956)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"To serve with a Gurkha soldier under the British Crown was, and is, a rare privilege which nobody who has shared it can ever forget."</span>   
Colonel B R Mullalay, 'Bugle and Kukri' (1957)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"The Almighty created in the Gurkhas an ideal infantryman, indeed an ideal Rifleman, brave, tough, patient, adaptable, skilled in field-craft, intensely proud of his military record and unswerving loyalty."</span>   
Field Marshal Viscount Slim, 'Unofficial History' (1959)<br><br>


<span class="quotes">"It was easy to command such people.  It was a privilege to be allowed to do so."</span> 
Patrick Davis, 'A Child at Arms' (1970)<br><br>

<span class="quotes">"Hearing a British Gurkha officer discuss his profession was something like hearing a priest discuss his vocation."</span>  
Byron Farwell, 'The Gurkhas' (1984)
